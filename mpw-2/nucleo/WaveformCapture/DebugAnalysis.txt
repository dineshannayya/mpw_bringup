1. Debug Anlysis: "Winbond SRAM not found" Error message while running the IO configuration test

Date: 15th Jan 2022
    Initial Debug shows 
    1. The Caravel Flash first access only working fine. 
    2. Flash access recover only with Power up sequence.
    3. Caravel Flash JEDEC Return value 
         JEDEC = 0xef4016 is corresponding to Winbond Serial Flash (0xeF) + 25Q32JV-IQ/JQ (0x4016). 
         It means caravel able to read the flash JEDEC

  Waveform Review:
    Logic Analyser capture at SPI Interface at Caravel Flash
    Capture-1: 1.BackToBack-JedecReadBurst.jpg
       1. First JEDEC command ( 3 Byte Response) is sucessfull
       2. At the end of JEDEC command, flash SO pin does not de-assert on CS# de-assetion
       3. Subsequent JEDEC command is not sucessful.

   Capture-2: 2.BackToBack-JedecSingleRead.jpg
       1. First JEDEC command ( 1 Byte Response) is sucessfull
       2. At the end of JEDEC command, flash SO pin does not de-assert on CS# de-assetion
       3. Second JEDEC Command ( 1 Byte Response) - Flash is responding in Command Phase it self
       4. Subsequent byte matches with JEDEC

  Summary: From above capture it looks like Flash CS# struck at zero and it does not recoginse the CS# de-assertion.

  Board Connectivity Review:
      Cross check the Flash singal connectivity from connector to caravel flash looks to good.

  Possibility: WinBond Pin #1 CS is faulty and detecting as Active low.
  Next Action: Try replaceing the caravel flash
